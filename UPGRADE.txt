UPGRADE notes for starpy python module
======================================

- References to zaptel functions have been converted into
  their DAHDI equivalents. For most of the functions, the 
  first three letters of the old function names "zap", 
  have been removed and replaced  with "dahdi".

  i.e. zapDNDoff is now dahdiDNDoff
