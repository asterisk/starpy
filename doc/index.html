  <title>StarPy Asterisk Protocols for Twisted</title></head>
<body>


<h1>StarPy
Asterisk Protocols for Twisted<br>


</h1>


<p class="introduction">StarPy
is a Python + Twisted
protocol that provides access to the Asterisk PBX's Manager Interface
(AMI) and Fast Asterisk Gateway Interface (FastAGI). Together these
allow you write both command-and-control interfaces (used, for example
to generate new calls) and to customise user interactions from the
dial-plan.&nbsp; You can readily write applications that use the AMI
and FastAGI protocol together with any of the already-available Twisted
protocols.</p>


<p class="introduction">StarPy is primarily intended to allow Twisted
developers to add Asterisk connectivity to their Twisted
applications.&nbsp; It isn't really targeted at the normal AGI-writing
populace, as it requires understanding Twisted's asynchronous
programming model.&nbsp; That said, if you do know Twisted, it can
readily be used to write stand-alone FastAGIs.<br>


</p>


<p class="technical">StarPy is Open Source, the we are interested in
contributions, bug reports and feedback. &nbsp;The contributors (listed
below) may also be available for implementation and extension contracts.<br>


</p>


<h2>Installation</h2>


<p>StarPy is a pure-Python
distutils extension.&nbsp; Simply unpack the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=164040">source
archive</a> to a temporary directory and run:</p>


<pre>python setup.py install<br></pre>


<p>You
will need <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> 2.3+ and
<a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a> (Core) installed.
You'll need <a href="http://basicproperty.sourceforge.net/">BasicProperty</a>
as well.&nbsp; If you want to check out the GIT version instead of a
released version, use:</p>


<pre>git clone https://github.com/asterisk-org/starpy.git</pre>

<p>On your PythonPath.</p>
<p>The demonstration applications use the <a href="pydoc/starpy.utilapplication.html">utilapplication</a> module,
which uses configuration-file-based setup of the AMI and FastAGI
servers.&nbsp; To use this, create a starpy.conf file for the current
directory (directory from which to run an example script) or a
~/.starpy.conf user-global file.&nbsp; Content of the configuration
file(s) looks like this:</p>


<pre>[AMI]<br>username=AMIUSERNAME<br>secret=AMIPASSWORD<br>server=127.0.0.1<br>port=5038<br><br>[FastAGI]<br>port=4573<br>interface=127.0.0.1<br>context=survey<br></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that FastAGI applications are neither encrypting nor
authenticating; you probably should not expose them on any interface
other than local (127.0.0.1)!</p>

<h2>Asterisk Manager Interface
(AMI) Usage</h2>


<p><span class="technical"></span></p>


<p>StarPy provides most of the
hooks you want to use on the protocol instances.&nbsp; The AMI
client is created by a client factory, as is standard for Twisted
operation.&nbsp; You can create a factory manually like so:</p>


<pre>from starpy import manager<br>f = manager.AMIFactory(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])<br>df = f.login('server',port)</pre>


<p>The factory takes the username
and secret (password) for the Asterisk manager interface (note: do not
actually pass in these values on the command-line in a real
application, as this would expose the username and password to anyone
on the machine).&nbsp; The deferred object returned from the login
call will fire when the AMI connection has been established and
authenticated.&nbsp; You register callbacks on the deferred to
accomplish those tasks you'd like to accomplish.</p>


<p>You will need to configure
Asterisk to have the AMI enabled and choose the username, password and
allowed hosts in
/etc/asterisk/manager.conf.&nbsp; You will also need to be sure that
the AMI user has sufficient permissions to carry out whatever AMI
operations you want to perform:</p>


<pre>[USERNAME]<br>secret=SECRETPASSWORD<br>permit=127.0.0.1<br>read = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user<br>write = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user</pre>


<p>Please keep in mind that the AMI
interface is not encrypted, so should never be run across an insecure
network.&nbsp; If you need to run across such a network, use ssh
tunnelling or the like to prevent eavesdropping!&nbsp; You will want to
read up on the <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Asterisk+manager+API">AMI</a>
in the voip-info Wiki.<br>


</p>


<p>The return value for the
login() deferred is an <a href="pydoc/starpy.manager.html#AMIProtocol">AMIProtocol</a>
instance.&nbsp; The various methods on the AMIProtocol generally
handle the creation and interpretation of "Action ID" fields.&nbsp;
The return value for most methods is an event, message or list of
events.&nbsp; Messages and events are modeled as dictionaries with
lower-case keys.</p>


<p>Perhaps the most common task desired for use with the AMI Protocol
is the creation of new calls.&nbsp; Here's a snippet showing such
generation:</p>


<pre>self.ami.originate( <br>	self.callbackChannel,<br>	self.ourContext, id(self), 1,<br>	timeout = 15,<br>)<br></pre>


<p>You will likely want to ignore the results of the originate, and
instead use an equal timeout waiting for an AGI connection to determine
whether you have connected (the AMI originate can "succeed" without a
successful connection, and will not tell you what channel is
created).&nbsp; If you want to track whether you have returned from a
particular call to originate, use a different extension for each
originate call (you can use UtilApplication's <a href="pydoc/starpy.utilapplication.html#UtilApplication-waitForCallOn">waitForCallOn</a>
method to register a one-shot handler if you are using UtilApplication).</p>


<p>Another common task is watching for an event of a particular type,
for instance a "Hangup" event.&nbsp; The AMIProtocol instance has a
method registerEvent that allows you to add a handler to be called
whenever an event of a given type is observed.</p>


<pre>def onChannelHangup( ami, event ):<br>	"""Deal with the hangup of an event"""<br>	if event['uniqueid'] == self.uniqueChannelId:<br>		log.info( """AMI Detected close of our channel: %s""", self.uniqueChannelId )<br>		self.stopTime = time.time()<br>		# give the user a few seconds to put down the hand-set<br>		reactor.callLater( 2, df.callback, event )<br>		self.ami.deregisterEvent( 'Hangup', onChannelHangup )<br>self.ami.registerEvent( 'Hangup', onChannelHangup )<br>return df.addCallback( self.onHangup, callbacks=5 )<br></pre>


<p><span class="technical">Note that the registerEvent and
deregisterEvent methods use object identity to manage the callbacks
being stored, as a result, a method is not a good handler (since method
objects are created and destroyed each time they are accessed) to
choose.&nbsp; A nested function that can be passed to deregisterHandler
is generally a better choice.&nbsp; Eventually we may use PyDispatcher
for the registration as it has solved this problem already in a far
more general way.</span></p>


<p>See the
examples/connecttoivr.py and examples/calldurationcallback.py scripts
for sample usage of the AMIProtocol</p>


<p><span class="technical">Note that StarPy uses floating-point seconds
for all time values in all interfaces, </span></p>


<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>
<h2>Fast Asterisk Gateway
Interface (FastAGI) Usage</h2>


<p>Again, most of the hooks you
want to use are provided on the protocol instances.&nbsp; FastAGI
is a server, and is thus created by a (non-client) factory like so:</p>


<pre>from starpy import fastagi<br>f = fastagi.FastAGIFactory(testFunction)<br>reactor.listenTCP( 4573, f, 50, '127.0.0.1')</pre>


<p>testFunction in the example above is the
operation to undertake when the Asterisk Server connects to the FastAGI
server.&nbsp; It takes a (connected) <a href="pydoc/starpy.fastagi.html#FastAGIProtocol">FastAGIProtocol</a>
instance as its only argument.</p>


<p>This FastAGI protocol has methods available which match those <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki-Asterisk+AGI">AGI functions</a>
documented in the voip-info wiki.&nbsp; Each method has basic
documentation in the automated reference linked above, but you will
want to use the wiki documentation to understand the semantics of the
calls.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the <a href="pydoc/starpy.fastagi.html#FastAGIProtocol-execute">execute</a>
method (known as exec (which is a Python keyword) in the AGI
documentation) allows you to access <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/index.php?page=Asterisk+-+documentation+of+application+commands">Asterisk
Applications</a> as well as AGI methods.</p>


<p>You use a FastAGI application
from your Dial Plan like this (note: arguments do not
appear to be passed to FastAGI scripts in Asterisk 1.2.1, unlike
regular AGI scripts):</p>


<pre>exten =&gt; 1000,3,AGI(agi://127.0.0.1:4573)</pre>


<p>Please keep in mind that the
FastAGI interface is neither encrypted nor authenticating!&nbsp; It
should never be run across an insecure network and should never be run
on a port that is accessible from a public network.&nbsp; Also keep in
mind that your FastAGI process must be running already when Asterisk
tries to connect to it, you need to code your FastAGI process to be
robust so that it is always available to Asterisk.<br>


</p>


<p>See the examples directory for
examples of FastAGI scripts.</p>


<p><span class="technical">Note that StarPy uses floating-point seconds
for all time values in all interfaces, </span></p>


<h3>Sequential Operations</h3>


The <a href="pydoc/fastagi.html#InSequence">InSequence</a>
class allows for easily setting up multiple chained deferred processes,
for instance when you want to play 2 or 3 sound files
sequentially.&nbsp;
It is used like this:
<pre>sequence = fastagi.InSequence()<br>sequence.append( agi.setContext, agi.variables['agi_context'] )<br>sequence.append( agi.setExtension, agi.variables['agi_extension'] )<br>sequence.append( agi.setPriority, int(agi.variables['agi_priority'])+difference )<br>sequence.append( agi.finish )<br>return sequence()<br></pre>


<p>Calling the populated sequence returns a deferred which fires when
all elements finish, or any element fails (raise an
exception/failure).&nbsp; The InSequence class is a trivial convenience
that avoids needing to define a new callable function for every
operation of a many-step operation.<br>


</p>


<h3>Menu Objects Usage</h3>


<p>The FastAGI interface includes basic support for creating hierarchic
<a href="pydoc/starpy.menu.html">IVR menus</a>.&nbsp; The purpose of
the menuing system is to encapsulate common UI functionality at a
higher level of abstraction than that seen in the raw FastAGI
interface.&nbsp; Menus are defined using "model" classes which describe
the desired features of the menu.&nbsp; An example <a href="pydoc/starpy.menu.html#Menu">Menu</a> using simple single-digit <a href="pydoc/starpy.menu.html#Option">Option</a> instances:</p>


<pre>m = menu.Menu(<br>	tellInvalid = False, # don't report incorrect selections<br>	prompt = 'atlantic',<br>	options = [<br>		menu.Option( option='0' ),<br>		menu.Option( option='#' ),<br>		menu.ExitOn( option='*' ),<br>	],<br>	maxRepetitions = 5,<br>)<br></pre>


<p>To invoke the menu, simply call it with a FastAGI protocol instance
as its first argument.&nbsp; The menu will repeat up to maxRepetitions
times if an invalid or null entry is chosen.&nbsp; If tellInvalid is
True, the menu will play an "invalid entry" message of your choosing on
an unrecognised entry, otherwise it will ignore invalid choices.</p>


<p>If a callable option is specified, such as <a href="pydoc/starpy.menu.html#ExitOn">ExitOn</a> or <a href="pydoc/starpy.menu.html#SubMenu">SubMenu</a>, the result of
calling that option with the AGI and the selected option will be
returned.&nbsp; This same mechanism allows for creating chained
sub-menus like so:</p>


<pre>menu.SubMenu( <br>	option='1',<br>	menu = menu.Menu(<br>		tellInvalid = False, # don't report incorrect selections<br>		prompt = ['atlantic',menu.DigitsPrompt(53),menu.DateTimePrompt(time.time())],<br>		options = [<br>			menu.Option( option='0' ),<br>			menu.Option( option='#' ),<br>			menu.ExitOn( option='*' ),<br>		],<br>	),<br>),</pre>


<p>which can be used as an option within a higher-level menu.</p>


<p>You can also specify an onSuccess callback in the Option, this will
be called (and it's value returned) if and only if that specific Option
is chosen by the user (it is called only if the Option is not itself
callable (which regular Option instances are not)).</p>


<p>The return value from a Menu is a chain of [ (option, digit), ... ]
pairs for the final option selected from the lowest-level menu.&nbsp;
An ExitOn option triggers a return to a higher-level menu; this is not
reported as a "final" option selection.</p>


<p>The Menu module includes a <a href="pydoc/starpy.menu.html#CollectDigits">CollectDigits</a> class
which may be used either as a top-level Menu or as a SubMenu-wrapped
option in a higher-level menu:</p>


<pre>menu.SubMenu(<br>	option='2',<br>	menu = menu.CollectDigits(<br>		soundFile = 'extension',<br>		maxDigits = 5,<br>		minDigits = 3,<br>	),<br>)<br></pre>


<p>Eventually the CollectDigits class should support review/cancel
options on completion.&nbsp; It would also be nice to get it to use the
prompt system, but as of yet I don't know of any way to make that work
with multi-character entry during the various sayXXX functions.</p>


<h3>Signalling Errors from FastAGI<br>


</h3>


<p>The FastAGIProtocol has a method <a href="pydoc/fastagi.html#FastAGIProtocol-jumpOnError">jumpOnError</a>
which is intended to be used for implementing the common Asterisk
application pattern of setting priority to some large value beyond the
current value in order to indicate an error in the application.&nbsp;
Yes, it's an ugly way to signal errors, but there it is.&nbsp; To use,
add jumpOnError to a deferred where you want any uncaught exception to
trigger a jump and finish the AGI connection.&nbsp; This would normally
be the overall deferred for your entire FastAGI operation.<br>


</p>


<pre>df.addErrback( agi.jumpOnError, 100 )<br></pre>


<p>If you only want to cause a particular jump on a particular
error/exception or set of exceptions, you can pass in a (tuple of)
error classes in the forErrors argument to which to restrict the jump:</p>


<pre>df.addErrback( agi.jumpOnError, 50, forErrors=error.OnUnknownUser )<br></pre>


<h2>Secondary Services</h2>


<p>The <a href="pydoc/starpy.utilapplication.html">utilapplication</a>
module contains a few simple classes which provide common services for
writing AMI/FastAGI applications.&nbsp; This includes
configuration-file setup of AMI and FastAGI services and an application
instance that provides methods for registering to handle incoming
FastAGI extensions.</p>


<pre># map incoming calls to extension 's' to the given method onS<br>APPLICATION.handleCallsFor( 's', someObject.onS )</pre>


<p>UtilApplication's agiSpecifier and amiSpecifier property point to
automatically generated <a href="pydoc/starpy.utilapplication.html#AGISpecifier">AGISpecifier</a>
and <a href="pydoc/starpy.utilapplication.html#AMISpecifier">AMISpecifier</a>
instances whose parameters are loaded from configuration files.&nbsp;
The specifier instances provide methods for starting up instances
configured by the specifier:</p>


<pre># tell the application to run a FastAGI server which dispatches<br># to handlers registered with handleCallsFor (as above)<br>APPLICATION.agiSpecifier.run( APPLICATION.dispatchIncomingCall )<br><br># tell the application to log into the configured AMI server<br># to allow for further management operations<br>df = APPLICATION.amiSpecifier.login( <br>).addCallback( self.onAMIConnect )<br></pre>


<h3>Simple FastAGI Application Example<br>


</h3>


<p>The following is the hellofastagiapp sample application, it uses the
starpy.conf file in the current directory to control the FastAGI setup,
and shows use of the utilapplication handleCallsFor method, which
allows for a single FastAGI server handling many different FastAGI
scripts (though in this case we only register a handler for one
extension, 's'):</p>


<pre>#! /usr/bin/env python<br>"""FastAGI server using starpy and the utility application framework<br><br>This is basically identical to hellofastagi, save that it uses the application<br>framework to allow for configuration-file-based setup of the AGI service.<br>"""<br>from twisted.internet import reactor<br>from starpy import fastagi, utilapplication<br>import logging, time<br><br>log = logging.getLogger( 'hellofastagi' )<br><br>def testFunction( agi ):<br>	"""Demonstrate simplistic use of the AGI interface with sequence of actions"""<br>	log.debug( 'testFunction' )<br>	sequence = fastagi.InSequence()<br>	sequence.append( agi.sayDateTime, time.time() )<br>	sequence.append( agi.finish )<br>	def onFailure( reason ):<br>		log.error( "Failure: %s", reason.getTraceback())<br>		agi.finish()<br>	return sequence().addErrback( onFailure )<br><br>if __name__ == "__main__":<br>	logging.basicConfig()<br>	fastagi.log.setLevel( logging.DEBUG )<br>	APPLICATION = utilapplication.UtilApplication()<br>	APPLICATION.handleCallsFor( 's', testFunction )<br>	APPLICATION.agiSpecifier.run( APPLICATION.dispatchIncomingCall )<br>	reactor.run()</pre>
